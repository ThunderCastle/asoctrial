The Enterprise License allows a specific number of your employees or Affiliate employees (each, a “Subscriber”) to access the Site. Each Subscriber must be designated by the enterprise purchasing the Enterprise License or by such enterprise’s designated Plan Manager, after which each Subscriber will be provisioned unique Account Information to receive access to use the Site through an individual, single-use subscription (an “Individual Business Subscription”). Each Individual Business Subscription is to be used solely for the internal purposes of the enterprise provisioning the Enterprise License. The Individual Business Subscription may not be shared amongst multiple employees, agents, or Affiliate employees. The number of your Individual Business Subscriptions and the initial license term (“Initial Business Term”) for such Individual Business Subscriptions will be set forth during Checkout or in a separate sales order form (each, a “Sales Order”), as applicable. Unless either party gives written notice to the other at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Business Term, the Individual Business Subscriptions provided under any Sales Order will automatically renew for subsequent terms (each, a “Renewal Business Term”) for the same length of term as the Initial Business Term, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in these Terms of Use.

  By way of example, if you select 10 Individual Business Subscriptions under an annual Business Plan during Checkout beginning January 1, 2016, we will process your Business Payment Method or invoice you for the annual cost of 10 Individual Business Subscriptions on the date of your Checkout. Your 10 Individual Business Subscriptions will expire on December 31, 2016, and unless you notify us at least 30 days prior to December 31, 2016, we will renew your Business Plan on or around January 1, 2017 for one year and on or around January 1st each year thereafter for 10 Individual Business Subscriptions at the then-applicable price for such subscriptions.

  If, however, you select 25 Individual Business Subscriptions under a two-year Business Plan during checkout beginning February 10, 2016, we will process your Business Payment Method or invoice you for the two-year cost of 25 Individual Business Subscriptions on the date of your Checkout. Your 25 Individual Business Subscriptions will expire on February 9, 2018, and unless you notify us at least 30 days prior to February 9, 2018, we will renew your Business Plan for an additional two years on or around February 10, 2018 and on or around February 10th every two years thereafter for 25 Individual Business Subscriptions at the then-applicable price for such subscriptions.

  (b) Enterprise Fee.

Disabling Automatic Renewal will cause us to stop automatically renewing your Business Plan at the end of the then-applicable subscription term. You will still be able to use the Site until the end of your current subscription term. Disabling auto renewal does not refund any portion of your Enterprise License Fee, as all Business License Fees are non-refundable. Please visit http://support.pluralsight.com/ for more details on Automatic Renewal.

  (v) Suspension Because of Nonpayment. If payment is not received within the required time period, or if we are unable to renew your Business Plan based on inaccurate or outdated Business Payment Method information, we may suspend your access to the Site (including the access of all your Individual Business Subscriptions) until payment is received. In the event we suspend your Business Plan because of nonpayment, no additional time will be added to the then-applicable Term of your Enterprise License.

  (vi) Taxes. The Enterprise License Fee is exclusive of taxes. When processing your Business Payment Method or sending a Pluralsight invoice, we may include a separate charge for any applicable sales, use, value-added, or excise taxes, and any other similar taxes, duties or charges of any kind, other than taxes on Pluralsight’s income, imposed by any federal, state, or local governmental entity on any amounts payable by you under these Terms of Use or any Sales Order.

The Subscribers under any Sales Order entered into with an Affiliate will also be bound by these Terms of Use.

For purposes of this definition, “control” means the power to direct the management or policies of such entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise. Ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting equity interests of an entity, either directly or indirectly, constitutes control of such entity, but the foregoing does not preclude a finding that a party may control another entity through ownership of less than fifty percent (50%) of such equity interests.
